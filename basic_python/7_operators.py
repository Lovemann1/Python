# there are 7 type of operators
#1. Arithmetic Operators i.e. +,-, *, /, for modulus(returns remainder) 5%3 output 2, flote division give you intiger 
    #   value of division symble = a//b it will give you only integer value, exponetialion function 5**3 output is 125
#2. Comparison (relatonal) Operators = {give you only true or false value} 
    #   operators are == for finding is it equal to any value, <, >, <=, >=

#3. Assignment Operators for assigning the operators i.e. (=)
#4. logical operator are ( and, or, not i.e. for reversing the result, return false if the result is ture)
#5. bitwise Operators 
#6. identity Operators (operators are is, is not, in, not in) 
    #is retrns true if both variables are the same object
    #is not returns true if both variables are not the same objects
   
#7. membership operators.
    #in returns true if sequence with the specified value is present in the object specified value is pressent in the object
    #not in returns true if a seqkuence with the specefied value is not present in the object
# identity location
